A role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.\n",

        "Federation allows trust relationships to be formed with external account providers such as GSuite or Active Directory.  Users defined in external account providers may be assigned to one or more Roles and granted access to AWS resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the AWS Big Data Exam you probably don't need to know much about Delegation or Federation.  These use cases tend to be covered by the Architect or DevOps exams.  Service and Service Linked Roles on the other hand must be understood to properly configure many of the Big Data services.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the definitions:\n",
        "\n",
        "From the AWS documentation\n",
        "\n",
        "\"A Service Roles is role that a service assumes to perform actions in your account on your behalf. When you set up some AWS service environments, you must define a role for the service to assume. This service role must include all the permissions required for the service to access the AWS resources that it needs. Service roles vary from service to service, but many allow you to choose your permissions, as long as you meet the documented requirements for that service. Service roles provide access only within your account and cannot be used to grant access to services in other accounts. You can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "So, a Service Role is simply a role that is assumed by an AWS service on your behalf.  You are responsible for creating the role and configuring the permissions.  The role must exist before the AWS service can be configured to use it.\n",

        "A Service-Linked Role is an evolution of the Service Role.  From the AWS docs:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"A unique type of service role that is linked directly to an AWS service. Service-linked roles are predefined by the service and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. The linked service also defines how you create, modify, and delete a service-linked role. A service might automatically create or delete the role. It might allow you to create, modify, or delete the role as part of a wizard or process in the service. Or it might require that you use IAM to create or delete the role. Regardless of the method, service-linked roles make setting up a service easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The Big Data services use a mix of Service Role and Service-Linked Roles in their respective configurations.  The Big Data exam doesn't ask directly about which services use Service-Linked Roles, but it does ofter ask detailed questions about configuring roles for these services, so it's important to know the requirements for setting up each.  We cover a few of these in detail in the next part of this lesson."
