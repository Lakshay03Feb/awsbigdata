    "One topic that you MUST understand to pass the AWS Big Data exam is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.  This has been covered on every AWS exam that I've ever taken.  The good news is that the concepts are very simple to understand:  You, as a solution designer have a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to ensuring data security.  As an AWS customer you share this responsibility with AWS.  The line of delinieation for that responsibility varies depending on the AWS services employed by the solution."
